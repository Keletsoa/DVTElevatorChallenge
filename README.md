# DVTElevatorChallenge

This is a console application in C# that simulates the movement of elevators, with the goal being to move people as efficient as possible.

The console application provides the following features:
- Show the status of the elevators, including which floor they are on, whether they are moving and in which direction, and how many people they are carrying
- provides a way to interact with the elevators, including calling them to a specific floor and setting the number of people waiting on each floor.
